# StationeersTools

StationeersTools can be used to:
+ Flatten a surface (circle, rectangular) from a center point (or player location in the future)
+ Create an empty space (cylinder, box, tunnel) from a center point (or player location in the future)

Future StationeersTools can be used to:
+ Charge batteries and/or make them all nuclear (GO NUKES!)
+ Quantify stacks to whatever amount you want. (This also stacks some unstackable items like the big batteries)
+ Trim the world to reduce save file size
+ Build structures to finish
+ Fill structures with reagents (Autolathe, hydraulic pipe bender, etc.)
+ Garbage cleanup
+ Remove entire pipe/cable networks (By network ID)
  + This will most likely remove the cables from the game, but I will try to experiment with spawning them back onto the ground

## Used in this project
